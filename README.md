Elements used for this page have been conjoined together for design purposes, therefore, there are no open elements left in the code.
h1 tags are all closed, otherwise it would not show in the browser appropriately. Additionaly div tags that were used mistakenly, have been reoved.

* Portfolio page - find my projects that I have done in University this year. Includes assignment 0 and assignment 1.

Alt attribute is not being used as the image contained is not for viewing, instead, on a click it takes directly to a website where all information regarding to the project is contained.
Therefore, I have not made any alterations to the code showing errors.
